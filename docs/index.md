## Why VSView

Modern, extensible previewer for [VapourSynth](https://www.vapoursynth.com/),
**VSView** lets you open scripts, videos or images in one interface, making it easier to preview, inspect and compare sources without switching tools.

Built as a modern replacement for [VSPreview](https://github.com/Jaded-Encoding-Thaumaturgy/vs-preview), **VSView** focuses on cleaner, more maintainable code and straightforward plugin integration through a clear API, making official and community extensions easier to build, maintain, and adopt.

## Quick start

Install and launch directly from your terminal:

=== "pip"
    ```bash title="Install and run"
    pip install vsview
    vsview
    ```

    ```bash title="Install with recommended plugins"
    pip install "vsview[recommended]"
    ```

    ```bash title="Open files directly:"
    vsview script.vpy video.mkv
    ```
=== "uv"
    ```bash title="Install and run"
    uv tool install vsview
    vsview
    ```

    ```bash title="Install with recommended plugins"
    uv add vsview --extra recommended
    ```

    ```bash title="Open files directly:"
    uv run vsview script.vpy video.mkv
    ```
