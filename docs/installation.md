# Installation

Choose your preferred package manager to install `vsview`.

We recommend the **[recommended](https://jaded-encoding-thaumaturgy.github.io/vs-view/plugins/second-party/#installation)** bundle for most users
so that useful plugins are available out of the box.

=== "pip"
    ```bash title="Minimal installation"
    pip install vsview
    ```

    ```bash title="Install with recommended plugins"
    pip install vsview[recommended]
    ```
=== "uv"
    ```bash title="Minimal installation"
    uv add vsview
    ```

    ```bash title="Install with recommended plugins"
    uv add vsview --extra recommended
    ```
